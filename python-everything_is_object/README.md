# Python - Everything is Object

This project explores one of the most important concepts in Python: **Everything is an object**.

## Overview

In Python, everything you use is an object, including numbers, strings, lists, and even functions. Understanding how objects, references, mutability, and assignment work is key to writing reliable and efficient Python code.

## Learning Objectives

- Understand what an object is in Python
- Know the difference between a class and an object (instance)
- Learn the difference between mutable and immutable objects
- Understand references, assignments, and aliasing
- Learn how to check if two variables point to the same object
- Identify built-in mutable and immutable types in Python
- Understand how Python passes variables to functions

## Project Structure

- Python scripts implementing tasks for the project
- Text answer files containing one-line answers for theory questions
- This README.md file

## Usage

All Python scripts start with the line:



```


Make sure to give executable permission to all Python files:



```


## Requirements

- All code should be compatible with Python 3.8.5 on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS
- Follow `pycodestyle` (version 2.7.*) coding style
- Each file should end with a new line
